//Create an array of movies with at least three movies.
const movArr = ['Shrek', 'Spider-Man', 'Bring It On'];
//Using the array from above, store the first movie in a variable
const movOne = movArr[0];
//Get the length of the original array and store it in a new variable
const movLength = movArr.length;
//Get the last element in that array and store it in a new variable. What if your array was really large and you didn't know the last index? Would your solution still work?
const movLast = movArr[movArr.length - 1];
